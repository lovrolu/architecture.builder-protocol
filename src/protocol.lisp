;;; Builder protocol
;;;
;;; This protocol allows producers such as parsers to construct object
;;; trees or graphs in an abstract fashion, i.e. independent of the
;;; concrete objects being constructing.
;;;
;;; This is achieved through two parts of the protocol:
;;;
;;; * Construction of nodes:
;;;
;;;   make-node builder kind &rest initargs             [generic function]
;;;
;;;   finish-node builder kind node                     [generic function]
;;;
;;; * Establishing relations between nodes
;;;
;;;   relate builder relation left right &rest args     [generic function]

   "Use BUILDER to make a result tree node of kind KIND and return it.

    When supplied, BOUNDS is of the form (START . END) and can be used
    to indicate the input range for which the tree is constructed."))

   "Use BUILDER to perform finalization for NODE and return NODE."))

(defgeneric relate (builder relation left right &rest args &key)
  (:documentation
   "Establish RELATION between nodes LEFT and RIGHT and return the
    resulting modified LEFT node (or an appropriate newly created
    object).

    ARGS can be used to supply additional information about the
    relation that is available from neither LEFT nor RIGHT.

    In a typical case, RELATION could be :child, LEFT being the parent
    node and RIGHT being the child node."))

;; This allows consumers to omit defining a method on `finish-node'.
(defmethod finish-node ((builder t) (kind t) (node t))
